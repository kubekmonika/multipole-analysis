## General info
Project created for the purpose of a master thesis. The goal is to create tools which allow performing analysis of electromagnetic field scattered over the nanostructures. In particular to find the electric and magnetic dipole moments.

## Technologies
* Matlab R2017a
* MNPBEM, Matlab Toolbox

## Status
The results are approximate and not fully tested.

## Setup
The MNPBEM toolbox can be downloaded from [here](http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/). One must be familiar with this toolbox to perform analysis. 

## Code example
Code examples available in the directory *examples*.
